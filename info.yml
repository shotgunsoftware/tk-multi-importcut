                      If the timecode is left empty or set to 'automatic',
                      the mapping is automatically determined on first import
                      from the timecode cut in and frame value + default head duration.
                      Otherwise, it should contain a timecode and a frame. For
                      example :
                      { timecode: '00:00:00:00', frame: 0} to use absolute timecodes."
